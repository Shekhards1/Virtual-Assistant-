# Virtual-Assistant-
Here I have made a virtual assistant using Python and various python libraries of speech recognition.
The assistant takes a speech command as input and performs action based on the command.
It can help users to simplify and automate daily repititive tasks,which takes users time and energy. Using this those tasks can be performed by using just a single speech command.
